Skew Normal Capstone
====================

This is my undergraduate capstone on the skew-normal approximation of the
binomial distribution. The paper I am explicating is "A Note on Improved
Approximation of the Binomial Distribution by the Skew-Normal Distribution," by
Chiang, et al.

Quick Intro
-----------

The normal distribution is a good approximation of the binomial when either n
is very large or p is close to 0.5. However, when neither of those conditions
are met, the binomial is skewed. The skew-normal distribution introduces a
third parameter, lambda, that attempts to capture this asymmetry.
