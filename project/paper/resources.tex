\section{Practical Resources}
\label{sec:resources}

We conclude our dicussion by offering the reader a few practical resources:

Table \ref{tab:sn-approx-table} shows estimations of $SN(\mu, \sigma, \lambda)$
for common binomial distributions.

For those with an unusual combination of $n$ and $p$ not in the table, Appendix
\ref{app:calc-sn-approx} demonstrates how to calculate the skew-normal
parameters by hand.

Finally, for rapidly approximating many binomial distributions, the author's
Python library, which was used to compute all values presented in this paper,
is freely available online:
